            I am a software developer and game developer with 4 years of experience in video game development and 1 year in software development. I have received my Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and pursuing more things within the game industry. I am also currently an independent game developer and full stack developer, working on a variety of exciting projects that showcase my skills and passion for programming.
            <br>
            <br>
            My focus is on releasing a game in 2024 that will be announced shortly later this year. I have also been exploring and attempting to create new software projects, including a bank website and a standalone application. I have experience with a range of programming languages and technologies, including Java, JavaScript, C#, and Unity, and I'm looking to broaden my skillset by learning new tools and techniques.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a game developer, I can understand the importance of creating immersive and engaging experiences for players. I have experience working with a range of game engines and programming languages, and am committed to creating games that are not only fun, but also intuitive to play.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my work as a software developer, I have focused on full stack development with a particular emphasis on web development. I have experience working with different front-end and back-end frameworks, including Angular and Spring, as well as programming languages such as Python and JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of my key strengths is my ability to work independently or as part of a team. I am committed to effective communication, problem-solving, and flexibility, and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are looking for a talented and dedicated software developer or game developer to join your team, I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your organization. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me to learn more about my work and how I can help bring your projects to life.
