I am a Full Sail University Alumni with my Bachelor's Degree in Game Design. I also have experience as a full stack java developer and I'm looking to put those skills to use anywhere that I can. I'm planning on releasing my first game in 2024, which is currently an unannounced title that I am working to announce very soon.

                            The Did We Brick It? E-Commerce Web Application provides the core features present in many common e-commerce applications.

I was responsible for creating portions of the profile page and the ability to create new products. As a team, we also created a presentation and presented it to multiple people within Revature. You can check out the website in the link below.

                            My portfolio is exactly where we are right now! I created this website utilizing the skills and abilities that I was able to gain over my training. Showcasing my projects both within games and software, I wanted to be able to have one place to concisely show off what I've been able to do over the past couple of years.

                            A top-down roguelike based on the game Binding of Isaac created by a team of 4 people for my capstone project at Full Sail University. Within the game, the player traverses 6 levels, all with a boss room, shop room and treasure room. There are locked rooms within each area as well. This game does not have procedural generation, a feature that proved to be too complex at the time.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This was a very difficult project to complete, as we started with 5 team members and by the end of it, we had 4 members left. This project taught me a lot about who I was as a game developer and what good team work really looks like. I spent countless nights up until 3-4 in the morning, trying to make sure that we had a presentable project from the week before. One other team member was helping me in these nights, and we started working on games together after university.

                            A game where I worked on a level as part of a team from Full Sail University. The level created was to obtain a golden honeybun and give it to the bastions (the quest givers). Within my level, I utilized the introduce, practice, master design patterns for introducing new mechanics to the player. The player goes through the level by destroying breakable walls and using a pressure plate mechanic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The level was inspired by my workplace, as I worked in a honeybun factory and I wanted to create an environment that felt similar to my workplace.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My own critique would be that I could have created the levels with more thought-out detail and mechanics and tried to do something more with them. At the time, I was going through a rough time and tried to do the best with what I was given. That is not to dismiss the faults within the level design, but I believe that the levels that I will be designing in my newest game will surpass them completely.

                            A top-down tower defense game where you play as the enemies that are preventing the heros from getting into your dungeon and stealing your resources, similar to the Dungeons series. From within the game, you are able to change and augment your boss, change and shape the terrain and place down towers on a grid. When the level starts, the enemies will start to navigate towards the crystal that the player needs to protect. The player's goal is to fight off the waves of enemies and build up their base.

                            Within Sneezing Panda Studios, we had over 10 members who were working on the game. We tried to take a hobbyist approach to it, working on things when we had time, but we quickly realized that wasn't really working. So eventually we had to disband the project.
